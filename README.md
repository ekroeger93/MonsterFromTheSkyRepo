old impact Javascript game



this was an old abandoned project of my +3-5 years in the making back when I didn't  know how to code any better so beware of that.
It uses a library called impactjs which was pretty prominent for its time.

Best way I can describe it, its a combination of a pinball ball and a slingshot game.

 It was a very grueling experience, due to me being a novice programmer at the time and lack of mathematical experience, alot of it had been built on seer stubbornness than intellect. 

I've came out learning to better appreciate mathematics and realizing how out of depth I actually was in my technical ability.

 Heartbreaking that I wasn't able to finish it completely, however being severely dedicated projects like this can actually hinder our learning ability and take more from us than we realize. Learning when to quit is a valuable lesson when the objective has diminishing returns; especially true when you are not fully prepared and you neglect your education.

Never learn a library framework or game engine before the language!
 

I published it on Newgrounds so if you want to try it out there you can:
